Mailchimp subscribe form block for Gutenberg editor. Simple. Works. No nonsense.

Need to collect some emails using Mailchimp? This is the Gutenberg block for you. Super-easy to use. Start collecting subscribers in minutes.

Works as any other Gutenberg block with the following settings:
* Mailchimp API key
* Mailchimp List
* Subscription Form Style
* Email Field Label
* Name Field Label
* Submit Button Label
